 Master's thesis. An Extension of Kou’s Jump-Diffusion Model to Incorporate Double-Gamma Distributed Jump Sizes.

論文_old.pdf contains all the work done, including greeks and greeks hedging on the Double-Gamma Jump-Diffusion Model, but my advising professors think that there are too much content and not enough time, so the greeks and greeks hedging part are left out of the final version.

We employ the Fast Fourier Transform method to obtain option prices for both models and use finite-difference methods to calculate the Greeks. By extending the model to the double gamma distribution not only reproduces the results of Kou's model but also provides enhanced flexibility in simulating the market, allowing for fine-tuning of the model.
